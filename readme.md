# 10kclub utils

In [token-ids.json](token-ids.json) you can find a list of the corresponding token ID for every ENS name in the 10k club.

ie. Opensea URLs can be constructed like this: https://opensea.io/assets/0x57f1887a8bf19b14fc0df6fd9b2acc9af147ea85/TOKEN_ID_HERE

If you have any other ideas that might be useful for building on 10kclub, let us know.
